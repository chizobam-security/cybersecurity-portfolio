# Information Security Fundamentals
Information security is state where the possiblility of tampering, theft or distruption of information or services on a system is low or tolerable.

Elements of information security includes:
- Confidentiality: Assurance that the information is accessible only to those authorized to have access
- Integrity: The assurance that the information is trustworthy
- Availability: Assurance that the information is accessible when required by the authorized user
- Non-Repudiation: Assurance that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and the recipient cannot deny having received the message

The security(Restriction), Functionality(features) and Usability(GUI) triangle: The higher the security in a system, the lesser the functionality and usability.

Classification of Attacks
- Passive Attacks: Does not affect system resources nor alter data. No interference and usually undetectable e.g sniffing, footprinting, traffic analysis etc.
- Active Attacks: Tamper with data or disrupt services e.g DoS, MITM, session hijacking etc.
- Close-in Attacks: Performed when in close proximity to the target e.g eavesdropping, shoulder surfing etc.
- Insider Attacks: Using privileged info to cause a threat. e.g planting keyloggers as an employee.

Information Security Vectors
- Cloud computing Threats: Error in configuration can allow attacker gain access
- Advanced Persistent Threat: Long-term stealthy attack designed to stay inside a network for months or even years.
- Viruses and Worms: Worms are independent and can spread very fast without human intervention while virus is dependent on a file and requires human action like opening the infected file for it to replicate.
- Phishing
- Ransomware
- Botnet
- Web Application Threats
- IoT Threats

Information Security Laws and Regulations
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS): Standard for organizations that handle cardholder information
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA): A US law that Provides protections for the personal health information(PHI) held by covered entities(doctors, hospitals etc) and their business associates.
- Sarbanes Oxley Act(SOX): Protects investors and the public from corporate fraud by increasing the accuracy and reliability of corporate dsiclosures.
- General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR): Toughest privacy and security law in the world passed by the European Union(EU). it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU

If HIPAA is about "Health," and SOX is about "Finance," GDPR is about "The Individual.
- The Digital Millennium Copyright Act(DMCA)
